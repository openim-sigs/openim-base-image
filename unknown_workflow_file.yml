Since the specific workflow file and the line numbers where the `dessant/lock-threads@v4` action is used are not provided in the issue description, it is not possible to provide the contents of the new file. However, the general approach would be to locate the `dessant/lock-threads@v4` action in the workflow file and update the credentials used by this action. This might involve updating the value of a secret used by the action.
